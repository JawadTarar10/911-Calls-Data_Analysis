For this  project we analyzed some 911 call data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mchirico/montcoalert). The data contains the following fields:

* lat : String variable, Latitude
* lng: String variable, Longitude
* desc: String variable, Description of the Emergency Call
* zip: String variable, Zipcode
* title: String variable, Title
* timeStamp: String variable, YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
* twp: String variable, Township
* addr: String variable, Address
* e: String variable, Dummy variable (always 1)

In this project we perform several data exploratory techniques for data analysis, we analyzed the frequency of different types emergency calls,
the areas from which the ratio of calls is frequent.
Lastly find the correlation between different aspects of the data and visualize them through heatmaps.
